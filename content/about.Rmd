> I am a Brazilian Political Scientist working mainly with participation in public policies. I have worked as a Visiting Researcher at the Institute of Development Studies [(IDS](https://www.ids.ac.uk/), from Nov 2018 to Nov 2019), University of Sussex, and have done a pos-doc in the Project “Participação Política – [Procad (Unesp/UEM/UFSC)](https://participacaopolitica.cfh.ufsc.br/)". I have experience working with quantitative data, using [R Programming](https://www.r-project.org/) language, and qualitative data, using [Nvivo](https://www.qsrinternational.com/nvivo/home).
