```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F)
```

In this post I will show the databases built within the scope of the ["Procad-Political Participation"](https://participacaopolitica.cfh.ufsc.br/) project that gather information about participatory institutions in Brazil.


First of all, let's load the required libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
```


Then, let's load the databes that are hosted on my [github](https://github.com/ronycoelho/Bases-Munics-IPs-e-Estadics-IPs)
```{r}
munic <- "https://github.com/ronycoelho/Bases-Munics-IPs-e-Estadics-IPs/raw/master/munics_ips/Munics_IPs.xlsx"

estadic <- "https://github.com/ronycoelho/Bases-Munics-IPs-e-Estadics-IPs/raw/master/estadics_ips/Estadic_IPs.xlsx"

base_munic <- rio::import(munic, sheet = 2)

base_estadic <- rio::import(estadic, sheet = 2)
```
  
Now, I will show you an imgage of the dictionary of Munics-IPs presenting its first lines

![Sample: dictionary - Munic-IPs](C:/myblogdown/static/dic_munic_.png)

You can find the complete version of the dicitonary in the of my github above

#

Now it's time to view the database itself. I will show only the first 100 variables and the first 300 observations. The full version has 5,570 rows (number of municipalities) and more than 1,000 columns.

```{r}
base_munic %>% 
  select(1:107) %>% 
  head(300) %>% 
  knitr::kable(table.attr='class="table-fixed-header"') %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F, position = "center")%>% 
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "400px")
```

#

The Estadics-IPs databases have a similar pattern to Munics-IPs. Here is a sample of its dictionary

![Sample: dictionary - Estadics-IPs](C:/myblogdown/static/dic_est_.png)

#

And an example of your database
```{r}
base_estadic %>% 
  select(1:104) %>% 
  knitr::kable(table.attr='class="table-fixed-header"') %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F, position = "center")%>% 
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "400px")
```
