```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F)
```

In this post I will show the databases built within the scope of the ["Procad-Political Participation"](https://participacaopolitica.cfh.ufsc.br/) project that gather information about participatory institutions in Brazil.

First of all, let's load the required libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(DT)
```

Then, let's load the databes that are hosted on my [github](https://github.com/ronycoelho/Bases-Munics-IPs-e-Estadics-IPs)
```{r}
munic <- "https://github.com/ronycoelho/Bases-Munics-IPs-e-Estadics-IPs/raw/master/munics_ips/Munics_IPs.xlsx"

estadic <- "https://github.com/ronycoelho/Bases-Munics-IPs-e-Estadics-IPs/raw/master/estadics_ips/Estadic_IPs.xlsx"

base_munic <- rio::import(munic, sheet = 2)

base_estadic <- rio::import(estadic, sheet = 2)
```
  
Now, I will show you an image of the dictionary of Munics-IPs, presenting its first lines

![](/post/post_munic_estadics_files/dic_munic_.png)

<hr style="height:500pt; visibility:hidden;" />

If you would like to load the dictionary, you can run
```{r}
# dic_munic <- rio::import(munic, sheet = 1)
```

You can find the complete version of the dicitonary on my github in the link above

It's time to view the database itself. I will show you only the first 100 variables and the first 300 observations. The full version has 5,570 rows (number of municipalities) and more than 1,000 columns.

```{r}
base_munic %>% 
  select(1:107) %>% 
  head(300) %>% 
  datatable(extensions = 'FixedColumns',
            rownames = F,
            options = list(autoFill = TRUE,
                           fixedHeader = TRUE,
                           autowidth = TRUE,
                           paging = F,
                           scrollX = TRUE,
                           scrollY = "400px")) %>% 
   DT::formatStyle(columns = c(1:107), fontSize = '75%')
```


The Estadics-IPs databases have a similar pattern to Munics-IPs. Here is a sample of its dictionary

And an example of your database
```{r}
base_estadic %>% 
  select(1:104) %>% 
  datatable(extensions = 'FixedColumns',
            rownames = F,
            options = list(autoFill = TRUE,
                           fixedHeader = TRUE,
                           autowidth = TRUE,
                           paging = F,
                           scrollX = TRUE,
                           scrollY = "400px"))%>% 
   DT::formatStyle(columns = c(1:107), fontSize = '75%')
```
