Apparently, Hugo (and Bogdown) doesn't support "toc_float" and "code_folding". To see how it actually works, go to this <a href="https://rpubs.com/r_rabbit/Toc_float">link</a> on my Rpubs page

```{r setup, include=T}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

#yaml
#----
#title: "Habits"
#output:
 # html_document:
  #  toc: true
   # toc_float: true
    # toc_depth: 3
    # code_folding: hide
#---

```

# 1. R Markdown 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## 1.1 Summary 1
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

### 1.1.1 Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# 2. R Markdown 

## 2.1 Summary 1
```{r}
summary(iris)
```

### 2.1.1 Including Plots
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = diamonds, 
       aes(x = carat, y = price, color = clarity)) +
    geom_point() +
  theme_dark()
```
